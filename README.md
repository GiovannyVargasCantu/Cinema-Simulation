# Cinema-Simulation
This program simulates an Cinema application (Cashier POV) 

The sad part about this code is that it's only in console, like we didnt implement the GUI, we didn't really have that much time in that semester, which was the 3rd semester, so we just kept it on console, but now that I think about it, maybe with GUi would be way easier not to mention that if we implement a database this program rocks, maybe I update it later.

This program had a User Manual to use it but i'ma delete it since it contains personal information, maybe in a future i Update the User Manual (WIP)
